# docker-acarshub

Docker container to view and also stream ACARS messages to [ACARS.io/Airframes.io](http://acars.io). Uses [libacars](https://github.com/szpajder/libacars), [acarsdec](https://github.com/TLeconte/acarsdec) and [vdlm2dec](https://github.com/TLeconte/vdlm2dec). Builds and runs on `arm64` and `arm32v7`. A container is provided for, but not tested, `amd64`, `arm32v6` (see below).

## Supported tags and respective Dockerfiles

* `latest` (`master` branch, `Dockerfile`)
* Version and architecture specific tags available

## Multi Architecture Support

Currently, this image should pull and run on the following architectures:

* `amd64`: Linux x86-64 (Builds, untested. If it works for you let me know!)
* `arm32v6`: ARMv6 32-bit (Older RPis) (Builds, untested. If it works for you let me know!)
* `arm32v7`: ARMv7 32-bit (Odroid HC1/HC2/XU4, RPi 2/3)
* `arm64`: ARMv8 64-bit (RPi 4 64-bit OSes)

## Thanks

Thanks to [mikenye](https://github.com/mikenye) for his excellent ADSB docker containers from which I shamelessly copied a lot of the ideas for setting up the docker container, as well as his excellent advice and help in getting this thing working.

## Required hardware

You will need an RTLSDR dongle, and if you want to feed both VDLM2 and ACARS you will need two dongles with unique serial numbers.

## Up-and-Running with `docker run`

```shell
docker run \
 -d \
 --rm \
 --name acarshub \
 -e STATION_ID_ACARS="YOURIDHERE" \
 -e FREQS_ACARS="130.025;130.450;131.125;131.550" \
 -e ENABLE_ACARS="true" \
 --device /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb \
fredclausen/acarshub
```

You should obviously replace `STATION_ID_ACARS` with a unique ID for your station.

## Up-and-Running with Docker Compose

```yaml
version: '2.0'

services:
  acarshub:
    image: fredclausen/acarshub
    tty: true
    container_name: acarshub
    restart: always
    devices:
      - /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb
    environment:
      - STATION_ID_ACARS=YOURIDHERE
      - FREQS_ACARS=130.025;130.450;131.125;131.550
      - ENABLE_ACARS=true
```

## Ports

No exposed ports are necessary to run the container. However, the built in webserver is available on port `80` if you wish the view messages in realtime.

## Volumes

No volumes are needed to run the container.

## Environment variables

There are quite a few configuration options this container can accept.

### General

| Variable | Description | Required | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|--------|
| `GAIN`     | Sets the gain for the dongle | No | `280` |
| `FEED`     | Used to toggle feeding to [ACARS.io](http://acars.io). If set to any non-blank value feeding will be enabled. | No | Blank |
| `ENABLE_WEB`  | Enable the web server. Set to a blank value to disable the web server. | No | `true` |
| `QUIET_LOGS` | By default the received ACARS/VDLM messages will be logged to the container's std output. To stop this, set to any non-blank value. | No | Blank |

### ACARS

| Variable | Description | Required | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|--------|
| `ENABLE_ACARS` | Toggle ACARS decoding on. If set to any non-blank value ACARS decoding will start | No | Blank |
| `STATION_ID_ACARS` | Your unique ID for the ACARS feed. Used on the [ACARS.io](http://acars.io) site. Follow the guide [here](https://app.airframes.io/about) for formatting. | Yes, if ENABLE_ACARS is enabled | Blank |
| `SERIAL_ACARS` | Serial of the RTLSDR dongle used for ACARS decoding. | Yes, if ENABLE_ACARS is enabled | Blank |
| `FREQS_ACARS` | List of frequencies, separaed by a single `;`, used for ACARS monitoring. | Yes, if ENABLE_ACARS is enabled | Blank |

### VDLM2

| Variable | Description | Required | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|--------|
| `ENABLE_VDLM` | Toggle VDLM decoding on. If set to any non-blank value VDLM decoding will start | No | Blank |
| `STATION_ID_VDLM`  | Your unique ID for the VDLM  feed. Used on the [ACARS.io](http://acars.io) site. Follow the guide [here](https://app.airframes.io/about) for formatting. | Yes, if ENABLE_VDLM is enabled | Blank |
| `SERIAL_VDLM`  | Serial of the RTLSDR dongle used for VDLM decoding. | Yes, if ENABLE_VDLM is enabled | Blank |
| `FREQS_VDLM`  | List of frequencies, separated by a single `;`, used for VDLM monitoring. | Yes, if ENABLE_VDLM is enabled | Blank |

## Viewing the messages

The container implements a basic web interface, listening on port `80`, which will show messages as they are received.

If `QUIET_LOGS` is disabled, received messages are also logged to the container log.

## Which frequencies should you monitor?

The [ACARS.io/Airframes.io](https://app.airframes.io/about) website has a great list of community derived frequencies that aircraft typically will broadcast ACARS/VDLM on, and what regions those are applicable to. The values provided in the example docker-compose/docker run example above are frequencies I have found to be good in the United States, with a decent level of traffic. I imagine the list is not complete, and could be refined better.

Some notes about frequencies:

* acarsdec and vdlm2dec are limited to monitoring 8 frequencies apiece
* The spread of frequencies for each decoder has to be within 2 Mhz.

## Logging

* All processes are logged to the container's stdout. If `QUIET_LOGS` is disabled, all received aircraft messages are logged to the container log as well. General logging can be viewed with `docker logs [-f] container`.

## Future improvements

ACARS decoding appears to be in active development, and as such, I expect a lot of movement in data-visualization and presentation to happen. This container will follow those developments and add in functionality as it appears.
