/**
 * Inline SVG Icon Base Styles
 *
 * The global _reset.scss applies `display: block; height: auto` to all SVG
 * elements. Decorative inline icons need different behaviour — they must flow
 * with surrounding text, size relative to the current font, and align to the
 * text baseline.
 *
 * Every icon component in src/components/icons/index.tsx applies the `.icon`
 * class automatically, so these overrides are applied consistently without
 * requiring any per-call-site CSS.
 *
 * The vertical-align value (-0.125em) matches Font Awesome's svg-inline--fa
 * rule so that icon-in-button layouts remain unchanged after the FA migration.
