TODO:
* Live filtering of messages/Update displayed messages with historical messages after filter update
* Stat generator / display on website
* Maybe tar1090 side by side display w/ messages?
* Move generator and listener functions in to own module so that application.py passes tasks off

* Timezone for the time stamp on web site
