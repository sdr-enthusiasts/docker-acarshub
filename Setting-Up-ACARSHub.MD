# Setting Up ACARS Hub

## Purpose

This document is designed to show the most common `docker-compose.yaml` setup that requires minimal, if any, modifications.

### Migrating from v2 to v3/NextGen

If you are migrating from `v2` to `v3/NextGen` this would be a fantastic starting place for you to copy/paste values from your old compose file. I also highly suggest backing up your old compose file just in case you need to roll back if there are bugs.

## How to do the setup

Please use the `yaml` file below and save it to your computer with docker installed. You need to modify a few lines to get started:

ACARS Hub:

- If you intend to feed VDLM, change `ENABLE_VDLM=false` to `ENABLE_VDLM=external`
- If you intend to feed ACARS, change `ENABLE_ACARS=false` to `ENABLE_ACARS=external`
- If you have a local `tar1090` instance and want to be able to click on a link in the message to see that plane on it,
  - Remove the `#` from the start of the line
  - After the `=` sign input the URL you use in your browser to visit `tar1090`, ie `http://192.168.1.100`
- If you are in the United States I recommend removing the `#` from the line with `IATA_OVERRIDE`
- If you have a source of `tar1090` ADSB data and want to enable the ADSB visualizations on the ACARS Hub website
  - Remove the `#` from the start of the line with `ENABLE_ADSB`
  - Remove the `#` from the lines `ADSB_LAT`/`ADSB_LON` and set each value appropriately
  - If you are **_NOT_** running `tar1090` on the same Pi as ACARS Hub
    - Remove the `#` from the `ADSB_URL` line and set the value to the **_FULL_** URL to the `aircraft.json` data, ie `http://192.168.1.100/data/aircraft.json`

If you have chosen to decode ACARS Data and have a RTL-SDR device dedicated to it, do the following under `acarsdec`

- Set the serial number to your device after the `=` on the line `SERIAL`
- Alter the frequencies, if need be
- Set your feed ID.

Otherwise, remove the `acarsdec` section

If you have chosen to decode VDLM Data and have a RTL-SDR device dedicated to it, do the following under `dumpvdl2`

- Set the serial number to your device after the `=` on the line `SERIAL`
- Alter the frequencies, if need be. Frequenices need to be 9 digits long and contain no period
- Set your feed ID.

Otherwise, remove the `dumpvdl2` section

## Final thoughts

This document is designed to get you up and started. I feel it's likely you will need to make minimal changes to the configuration options provided above; however `ACARS Hub` in particular has a few more options you can add and tweak to your needs. Please see the [Readme](README.md) for more on that.
